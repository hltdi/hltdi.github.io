{"name":"HLTDI lab","tagline":"Human Language Technology and the Democratization of Information","body":"### HLTDI\r\n[HLTDI](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~gasser/Research/hltdi.html) is a research group for human language technology and the democratization of information, led by [Michael Gasser](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~gasser/). We work, more or less, on natural language processing tools for under-represented languages, focusing these days on machine translation. You can pronounce \"HLTDI\" like \"HuLaTeDi\".\r\n\r\n### What are you doing?\r\nOh, a few different things. Here are some links to our open source repositories:\r\n\r\n  * [L3](https://code.google.com/p/hltdi-l3/), our machine translation system based on dependency grammars (code for morphological analyzers is also here)\r\n  * [Cross-lingual word sense disambiguation](https://github.com/alexrudnick/clwsd) -- tools for lexical choice in hybrid machine translation systems\r\n  * [webapps for collecting corpora for under-resourced languages](https://github.com/hltdi/gn-documents) -- we're building these out for Guarani first. Watch for a public launch pretty soon...\r\n  * Other projects might collect on our [github organization page](https://github.com/hltdi)...\r\n  * ... and also on Michael Gasser's [research software page](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~gasser/Research/software.html).\r\n\r\n### Who are you?\r\n[These people](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~gasser/Research/people.html) and [also these people](https://github.com/hltdi?tab=members), and maybe you too, if you want to help!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
